## More about me

I'm a programmer based on S√£o Paulo - Brazil. Currently I'm working for the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine/godot) project as the maintainer of GDScript (their custom scripting language).

I learned programming when I was about 7 years old by drawing with Basic in a 386 computer with MS-DOS, after my brother taught me. Also playing a bit with DBase in the very same computer. Over time I got to learn some other things by myself, like Visual Basic, Delphi, Web stuff like HTML, JavaScript, VBScript (that was thing), ASP (not ASP.Net), PHP, and the list goes on. Jack of all trades master of none.

Games were always a bit of a passion of mine and I enjoy making stuff more than playing games. Though I'm the worst to have game ideas so I never really did anything besides clones for fun (or started huge story-driven projects that stopped not far from the beginning). Nowadays I work indirectly with games by coding for the Godot Engine.

If you know me from Godot, I'm also helping with GDExtension (the API for native dynamic modules), besides working here and there with other engine areas.

I also play the guitar (not very well) as a hobby and I like to write fiction when the mood strikes.
